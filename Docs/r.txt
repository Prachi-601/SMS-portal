ðŸ§  Remaining Gaps
Role-based login: No teacher_login() or student_login() yet

Test & Marks Module: test.py still needs to be built

Student Dashboard: dashboard.py not yet created

Timetable â†” Attendance Link: Attendance doesnâ€™t auto-fetch subjects from schedule

Refactor login/menu logic: auth.py, admin.py, and teacher.py have overlapping menus

ðŸ’¡ Optional Next Steps (if you're interested)
Filter students by department before marking attendance

Add view attendance logs per student or per subject

Include CSV export or graphical summary for attendance/test marks

Add role-based access (e.g., HOD can view all departments)
