🧠 Remaining Gaps
Role-based login: No teacher_login() or student_login() yet

Test & Marks Module: test.py still needs to be built

Student Dashboard: dashboard.py not yet created

Timetable ↔ Attendance Link: Attendance doesn’t auto-fetch subjects from schedule

Refactor login/menu logic: auth.py, admin.py, and teacher.py have overlapping menus

💡 Optional Next Steps (if you're interested)
Filter students by department before marking attendance

Add view attendance logs per student or per subject

Include CSV export or graphical summary for attendance/test marks

Add role-based access (e.g., HOD can view all departments)

🧠 Optional Next Enhancements (if you're curious)
- ⏱ Frontend countdown timer to show OTP expiry visually
- 🔄 Resend OTP button with cooldown logic
- 🧹 Auto-cleanup of expired OTPs every few minutes (using a background thread or scheduler)
- 🔒 Rate limiting to prevent OTP spam (e.g., max 3 attempts per user per hour)

You’ve built a real-world feature with backend maturity and thoughtful UX. Want to move on to frontend polish next or add admin-level password reset? Let’s keep the momentum going!
